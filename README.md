# SPWB
AGSIT is proud to open source the **S**ignal **P**rocessing **W**ork **B**ench (SPWB) software under the MIT license.  The [SPWB](https://agsit.github.io/SPWB/) was developed about a decade ago as a general use signal processing software.  It has been successfully used in a wide range of applications by countless customers.  The SPWB software has reached is end-of-life, so instead of simply retiring it, it was decided to open source it so it can be usefull to a new generation of users. 

The current repo contains ALL the LabVIEW vi required to run the software within LabVIEW.  It also contains compiled stand alone versions that can be run using the free runtime engine from National Instruments when LabVIEW is not an option for the user.

The SPWB software can be installed in two  different ways depending on the user preference:
* [**Cloning the repo**](https://github.com/agsit/SPWB/wiki/Installation-Options#1-repo-cloning) <br>
  If the user has LabVIEW professional 2020 or above, then cloning the repo is the easiest way and gives access to all the open source software.

The next method does not require the user to have access to LabVIEW. In this case, the user will have a fully functional software but since it is a compiled version, the user will not have access to the code itself.  The get access to the code, LabVIEW is required and option 1 above is the one to use.
<br>

* [**Windows Installer**](https://github.com/agsit/SPWB/wiki/Installation-Options#2-windows-installer)<br>
The second option consist of using a Windows Installer.  This implies that the user must have administrator rights to install it.  Furthermore, since the download is an *.exe files, Windows 10 will have a series of security warnings during the download and installation since the installer is not digitally signed.
